Interactive Visualization: http://shivaninanda-covid19-grapher.herokuapp.com

Since many people across the United States are affected by COVID-19, we wanted to create a tool that would show an interactive visualization of the various case and death rates across the country. It uses COVID-19 data found from the New York Times and 2019 population estimates from the United States Census Bureau. The interactive visualization tool uses Python and Dash by Plotly, a Python framework for building web analytic applications, so users can see updated graphs when they select different parameters. It also uses k-means clustering (a machine learning method to group data into a user-defined number of clusters) to group counties that have similar case rates over time. Overall, the interactive visualization tool shows: (1) daily COVID-19 cases and deaths for a particular state, (2) cumulative deaths and cases for each county in the state (colored by cluster), and (3) a casesâ€™ trend line for each of the county clusters. The interactive visualization tool can be used to explore differences in county-level COVID-19 trends.
